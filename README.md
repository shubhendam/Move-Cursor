# System Keep-Alive Automation with Cursor Movement

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9-blue.svg)

## Description
This repository contains a simple Python script named `move.py` that automates cursor movement on your system to keep it active. The script randomly moves the cursor within a specified region on the screen and performs a left-click action. It is especially useful during work-from-home situations when you need to prevent your system from going into sleep mode.

By creating a shortcut for the `move.py` file and assigning it a custom shortcut key, such as Ctrl + Alt + M, you can easily trigger the script from anywhere on your system. This allows you to keep your system awake and active even when you're away.

The script provides real-time feedback by displaying the number of times the cursor movement has been executed and the current system time, helping you keep track of the activity.

## Requirements
To run the script, make sure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install the required library using the following command:
`pip install pyautogui`



## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using the command mentioned above.
3. Create a shortcut of the `move.py` file.
4. Right-click on the shortcut file and go to Properties.
5. In the Properties window, navigate to the Shortcut tab.

6. Assign a custom shortcut key, such as Ctrl + Alt + M, to the Shortcut Key field.
7. Click Apply and then OK to save the changes.
8. Double-click the shortcut or use the assigned shortcut key to run the script.
9. The script will continuously move the cursor within the specified region and perform left-clicks to keep the system active.
